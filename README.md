## Disclaimer

Hi, due to a sudden fever and system reformat, I had only 6–7 hours to complete this exam, including the time spent reinstalling Visual Studio and Docker.

While I understand time constraints exist, I believe coding exams should allow at least 3 days. The quality of output — not speed — better reflects a candidate's skill. Rushing a full-stack implementation doesn't simulate real-world standards or allow thoughtful architecture.

This submission represents what I could produce under pressure. Thank you for your understanding.
